## About Us


Team NITRo is a rescue robot development team operated by students from the Sato Laboratory at Nagoya Institute of Technology.

The team is currently developing a crawler-type robot named IMAX2, and participates in competitions such as RoboCup and the World Robot Summit.

## Main Objectives
- Navigating rough terrain, manipulator-based operations, remote control, mapping, autonomous navigation, as well as image recognition and image processing are the main objectives.
- The team is advancing both hardware fabrication from CAD design and software development using ROS (C++/Python).

## Achievements
- **RoboCup 2024**: Participated in the RoboCup Rescue Robot League with IMAX2, achieving a commendable performance.
- **RoboCup 2025**: Scheduled to participate in the RoboCup Rescue Robot

## Robots
- **IMAX2**: A crawler-type rescue robot designed for navigating complex environments and performing rescue operations.
- **IMAX**: A large size crawler-type rescue robot, which was the predecessor of IMAX2 and participated in the RoboCup 2024 competition.

- **KAMUY**: Legged Robot

## Team Members
- **Kotaro Kanazawa**: Team Leader and Developer
